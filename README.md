# Kerbalism Unofficial Extensions

I'm using this repository to develop some Kerbalism changes I feel "clicking" and enhance 
the general experience in my personal opinion.

Since these are my first steps in KSP modding, I'm still not opening a Pull Request to official Kerbalism mod. 
If I find these satisfying and Kerbalism team agrees, I'll be glad to integrate the changes with them.

At the moment, only **Experiment Resetter** is implemented.

## Experiment Resetter

This Mod introduces the ability for Kerbals in EVA to restore _depleted experiments_ in Kerbalism, so
Material Bay and Goo Experiment are affected, since when you launch them you bring some **samples** and when
they finish science will stop.

To do so, Kerbals should take an EVA near the experiment and bring with themselves a **Samples Refill**, a new
Cargo part this mod introduces. After that, in the Part Action Window you'll find a "Refill Samples" action
which will restart the science experiment.
